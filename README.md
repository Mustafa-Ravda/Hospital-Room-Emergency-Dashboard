## Project Objective

To create a hospital emergency room analysis dashboard in Excel to improve efficiency and provide useful insights. This dashboard will help stakeholders analyze, monitor and make better decisions for managing patients and improving service

## KPI's

**Number of patients:**

Count the total number of patients visting the ER each day.
Show a daily trend with an area sparkline to spot patterns like busy days or seasonal trends

**Average wait time:**

Find the average time patients wait to see a medical professional.
Use an area sparkline to track daily changes and highlight days with longer wait times that might need improvements 

**Patient satisfaction score:**

Check the average daily satisfaction score of patients to assess service quality.
Use an area sparkline to show trends, spot drops in satisfaction, and link them to challenges

## Tools Used: 

Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)

## Insights from the Emergency Room Analysis:

**Patient Volume:**

A total of 9,216 patients visited the emergency room during the period.

**Service Efficiency:**

59% of patients were attended on time, while 41% faced delays — indicating room for process improvements.

**Admission Breakdown:**

Almost evenly split between admitted (50.04%) and not admitted (49.96%) cases.

**Gender Distribution:**

51% male and 49% female patients — a nearly balanced gender ratio.

**Age Group Trends:**

The 30–39 age group had the highest visits (1,200 patients), followed closely by 20–29 and 10–19 age groups.

All age groups from 10–79 had relatively uniform distribution, suggesting widespread ER utilization.

**Department Workload:**

General Practice (1,840) and Orthopedics (995) were the most visited departments.

A large number of patients (4,000) were not assigned to any department, which could indicate general triage or non-specific cases.

**Performance Metrics:**

Average wait time: 35.26 minutes — a key area to monitor for service improvement.

Patient satisfaction score: Very low at 4.99 out of 10, suggesting a negative patient likely due to delays.
